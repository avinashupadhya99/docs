# Why Telepresence?

Let's assume you have a web service which listens on port 8080, and has a Dockerfile which gets built to an image called `examplecom/servicename`.
Your service depends on other Kubernetes `Service` instances (`thing1` and `thing2`), and on a cloud database.

The Kubernetes staging environment looks like this:

```mermaid
graph LR
  subgraph Kubernetes in Cloud
    code["k8s.Pod: servicename"]
    s1["k8s.Service: servicename"]---code
    code---s2["k8s.Service: thing1"]
    code---s3["k8s.Service: thing2"]
    code---c1>"Cloud Database (AWS RDS)"]
  end
```

### The slow status quo

If you need that cloud database and those two services to directly test your software, you will need to do the following to test a change:

1. Change your code.
2. Build a Docker image.
3. Push the Docker image to a Docker registry in the cloud.
4. Update the staging Kubernetes cluster to use your new image.
5. Wait for the image to download.

This is slow.

```mermaid
graph TD
  subgraph Laptop
    code["Source code for servicename"]==>local["Docker image"]
    kubectl
  end
  subgraph Kubernetes in Cloud
    local==>registry["Docker registry"]
    registry==>deployment["k8s.Deployment: servicename"]
    kubectl==>deployment
    s1["k8s.Service: servicename"]---deployment
    deployment---s2["k8s.Service: thing1"]
    deployment---s3["k8s.Service: thing2"]
    deployment---c1>"Cloud Database (AWS RDS)"]
  end
```

### A fast development cycle with Telepresence

Telepresence works by running your code *locally*, as a normal local process, and then forwarding requests to/from the Kubernetes cluster.

```mermaid
graph TD
  subgraph Laptop
    code["Source code for servicename"]==>local["local process"]
    local---client[Telepresence client]
  end
  subgraph Kubernetes in Cloud
    client-.-proxy["k8s.Pod: Telepresence proxy"]
    s1["k8s.Service: servicename"]---proxy
    proxy---s2["k8s.Service: thing1"]
    proxy---s3["k8s.Service: thing2"]
    proxy---c1>"Cloud Database (AWS RDS)"]
  end
```

This means development is fast: you only have to change your code and restart your process.
Many web frameworks also do automatic code reload, in which case you won't even need to restart.
